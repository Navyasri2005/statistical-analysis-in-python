# 1. Descriptive Statistics
*Mean: Average value of a dataset. It is computed as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
*Median: Middle value of a dataset when sorted. It is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.
*Mode: Most frequently occurring value in the dataset. There can be multiple modes.
*Standard Deviation: Measures the spread of data around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability.
*Variance: The square of the standard deviation. It also measures variability but in squared units.
# 2. Hypothesis Testing
*Null Hypothesis (H₀): Assumes no effect or difference. It is the default assumption that is tested.
*Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Assumes there is an effect or difference. It is what you want to prove.
*P-value: Probability of observing the test results under the null hypothesis. A p-value less than 0.05 often indicates statistical significance.
*T-test: Compares the means of two groups to see if they are significantly different. Variants include the one-sample t-test, independent t-test, and paired t-test.
*ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Compares means among three or more groups to see if at least one group mean is significantly different from the others.
#3. Regression Analysis
*Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It estimates coefficients that describe this relationship.
*Coefficients: Represent the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.
*R-squared: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Ranges from 0 to 1.
*P-values in Regression: Assess whether the coefficients are significantly different from zero, indicating a meaningful relationship.
# 4. Confidence Intervals
*Confidence Interval: A range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a specified probability (e.g., 95% confidence interval). It gives an estimate of the precision of the sample statistic.
# 5. Correlation
*Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures the linear relationship between two variables. Ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).
*Spearman Rank Correlation: Measures the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables.
# 6. Visualizations
*Histograms: Show the distribution of a single variable.
*Box Plots: Visualize the distribution and identify outliers.
*Scatter Plots: Display the relationship between two continuous variables and help visualize correlations.
*Regression Lines: Illustrate the relationship between variables in a regression analysis.
These concepts form the foundation of statistical analysis in Python and can be implemented using libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, and matplotlib.
